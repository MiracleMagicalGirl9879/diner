				</p>
		
			<h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>	
				<p> I like to play games specially Goddess of Victory:Nikke, Wuthering Waves, Roblox and Honkai:StarRail <br>
					because they're fun and help me improve my vocabulary at some point. <br> 
					My second hobby is cardistry since I like how it looks and collect playing cards and I have 7 decks of cards currently in my house. <br>
					The final hobby in my list is learning instruments since I've enjoyed music for quite a long time now and the instruments that I've learned are recorder, guitar and the ukulele
					and I want to learn the piano but I don't have money to buy me one.
				</p>
		
		<h2>Goals for the Future</h2>
				<p> My goals is to learn C++ and make some sort of game and win 200,000 Pesos on Scratch It. <br>
					My other goals is to become a software engineer, give my parents a good life, make games and make music but 
					my enemy is always myself being lazy.
